# ListMovieFilesByCreationDate
This is a small Python script using [FFmpeg]('https://ffmpeg.org') to get the creation date of video files.


## How to use it
`getfilebyts.py <directory with files>`

### Note
There will be a lot of output from `ffmprobe` being forked and returning all its output to `stdout`. The resulting list will show up at the end of the program.
